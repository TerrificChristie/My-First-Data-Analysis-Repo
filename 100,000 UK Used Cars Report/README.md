* What is the correlation between the price and mileage of the cars?
* What is the distribution of fuel types across the dataset?

## Data Transformation

 - Data Gathering: The dataset file comprising thirteen different files was imported into Microsoft Power BI using a Folder connector to import all the files at once.

- Data Cleaning and Modelling: To make the data usable for the required analysis, the following tasks were performed:
1. I performed the cleaning of the data by removing errors and null values. 
2. I replaced the year 2060 with 2006. 
3. Different variables were distributed into classes for ease of analysis. 
4. Additional columns were created to calculate the ages of the cars.
5. Modelling was carried out between the data to ensure accurate connectivity.
