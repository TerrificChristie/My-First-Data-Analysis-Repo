![](hr_analytics1.jpeg)


...
## Project Objective

To carry out an analysis of human resources data and bring out insights that will help decision-making in optimizing talent management and organizational performance.




....
## Data Sourcing

The dataset was provided by MeriSkill US as an internship project dataset.



## Data Transformation

Necessary data cleaning was carried out to remove redundant columns, drop duplicates, and rename columns using Power Query in Power BI

I grouped data in columns representing employees' job satisfaction, work-life balance, relationship satisfaction, and performance rating. This is to enable a  neat classification of such parameters.


With the clean data set, it was easy to carry out analysis and bring out useful insights. New measures were also used in Power BI for further analysis without burdening the report with more columns.


- Data Visualization: By using the results of the analysis, an interactive dashboard and visualizations were created to describe the insights.

The first page of the visuals is dedicated to the overview of the entire dashboard.

Page two of the visual shows the employees' demographics. On this page is the summary of the impact of attrition based on gender, marital status, distance from home, and age group.

The last page displays the relationship between attrition and employees' wellness by considering the job satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, environmental satisfaction, job involvement, and work-life balance of employees.

## Recommendations:

1. The research and development department needs to be monitored to understand the reason behind the highest attrition rate experienced there. Consideration should be taken to whether the high attrition has any relationship with low performance. Are the right people employed? and so on.
2. The onboarding process of new employees needs to be overhauled to confirm that it serves the purpose of adequate training for the new entrants. 
3. Training should be considered for entry-level employees if the high attrition level is due to under-performance.
4. Staff welfare and health must be considered to ensure that the working environment is satisfactory.
5. Employees should be carried along and allowed to be more involved in business activities. This will increase their buy-in and trust.
6. The working conditions of overtime employees should be considered.
